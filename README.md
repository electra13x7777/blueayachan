# blueayachan
## My third (and most functional) twitch IRC bot

### What is this?
blueayachan is a twitch IRC Bot with a more "iterative" (lazy) approach to it's design to maximize enjoyment for the user.

### Features!
* High speed "SFW" image scraping from Danbooru
* Tons of gacha commands
* Lots of good memes
* User's can choose to omit commands they don't want to have in their channel (will eventually allow for this to be done in IRC)
* User level ability to add and remove their own channels to and from the bot with a single command (you don't have to ask me to add you!)

### "Good" Commands (there are more commands than just these but they probably suck)
#### Image Scraping
* !ayapic -  Queries safebooru and returns a link to a picture of Aya Shameimaru
* !maripic - Queries safebooru and returns a link to a picture of Marisa Kirisame
* !tsukipic - Queries safebooru and returns a link to a picture of a character from tsukihime/melty blood. Can search for specific characters using the keywords for different tags. Find kewords with `!tsukipic -keys`
* !amepic - Queries safebooru and returns a link to a picture of Amelia Watson
* !etrianpic - Queries safebooru and returns a link to a picture from Etrian Odyssey

### Special Thanks
It's pretty obvious, but this project was heavily inspired by bots that came before it.
* Botwoon by Dessyreqt
* FUNtoon by Taw_
* ZeppyZ by Kuribon
* Frigbot by Flameberger

These bots have all entertained me immensely over the years and I am very thankful to their creator's hard work to make such simple programs create such engaging user experiences.
